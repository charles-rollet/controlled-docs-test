Quality documents are a core part of the **Controlled Documents** module. They’re used to manage compliance content such as **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** and **Work Instructions (WIs)**.

⚠️ **Tip:** To follow this guide and complete the steps at the same time, we recommend opening **two browser windows** — one for this guide and one for the Controlled Documents module.

ℹ️ **Note:** For easier onboarding, all **roles and permissions** have been **disabled**, so you can freely explore and test TraceX capabilities without restrictions. You can re-enable them anytime for realistic permission management.

## ✅ Follow These Steps

1. From the menu on the left-hand side, select the **Controlled Documents** module.

2. Click the blue **“+ New Document”** button at the top left.

### Then complete the steps in the creation wizard:

---

#### 🧭 Step 1: Select the space and parent

• Choose the **space** where your document will live.  
• The space controls the roles and access permissions *(disabled for onboarding)* so you can explore freely.  
• Choose whether the document is **top-level** or a **child of another document**.

---

#### 🧩 Step 2: Choose a template

• Select a **template** that matches your document type.

---

#### 📝 Step 3: Enter document info

• Fill in the **title**, **description**, and the **reason** for creating this document.

---

#### 👥 Step 4: Assign the team

• Assign **Co-Authors** (optional), **Reviewers** (optional), and **Approvers**.  
• Since you’re the only user in this workspace for now, simply assign yourself to **keep the approval workflow moving**.

---

✅ Once you're done, click **“Create Draft”** to begin editing the document.

---

🎉 **Congratulations!** You’ve now completed **Step 2** ✅
